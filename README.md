# ConducTab

A Chrome browser extension that helps you control audio and video playback across multiple tabs with ease.

```

### Architecture

- **Background service worker** listens for `tabs.onUpdated` (audible changes, page loads) and `tabs.onRemoved` events only — zero CPU when idle
- **Popup** reads shared state from `chrome.storage.local` and listens for changes
- **Media detection** validates that elements have a loaded source and valid duration before flagging a tab
- **License state** stored in `chrome.storage.sync` so it persists across devices
- **Feature gating** via `License.hasFeature()` checks — premium UI shown but locked for free users

### Permissions Required

- `tabs`: For accessing and managing browser tabs
- `scripting`: For executing scripts in tabs to control media playback
- `storage`: For maintaining state between sessions
- `host_permissions`: Access to all URLs for media detection

## Development

### Building and Testing

1. Make changes to the source files
2. Load the extension in Chrome using "Load unpacked" (select the `extension/` folder)
3. Click the refresh button in `chrome://extensions/` to reload after changes
